### Wordpress Automated Migration Plugin

This plugin helps migrating your blog easily without the need of modifying your functions.php file or define constants in your wp-config.php file.

In terms of how it works, if the host changes, this plugin will simply update the database with the new details.

Simply drop this folder into your `wp-plugins` directory and activate it from WP-Admin -> Plugins.
